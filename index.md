# Ball Detecting Robot with Raspberry Pi
I am working on a Raspberry Pi Machine Learning model which will detect a ball and a robot will move towards it.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was programming my motors to move change direction. Once I set up the Rasperry Pi, I connected the motor driver and the motors to the raspberry pi. I then used those pins to create my code. The first step to my code was to get the motors to move forwards and backwards and stop. Once I completed that task, I moved onto turning left and right. After my code was complete and the motors were functional, I assembled the chassis so I could see the robot in action instead of just the motors.
